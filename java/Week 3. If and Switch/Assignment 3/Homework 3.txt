Homework 3 Valid Triangles

Write a program that reads three integers using Scanner class. Determines whether the integers can form the sides of a valid triangle. If the 3 numbers form a valid triangle, display the perimeter. If they do not form a valid triangle, print a message saying so.

The 3 integers form a valid triangle if the sum of each two is greater than the third. That is, side1 + side2 must be greater than side3; AND side2 + side3 must be greater than side1; AND side1 + side3 must be greated than side2.

Sides of 1, 1, 2 do not form a triangle, but sides of 2, 2, 1 do form a triangle as do the sides 3, 4, 5.

Test your program thoroughly. At a minimum, test one set of numbers that form a triangle and one set that does not. Remember to paste the result of all the runs onto the bottom of your source code inside a comment.

Sample output:

/*-----OUTPUT ------

Enter an integer: 1
Enter another integer: 1
Enter one more integer: 2

1, 1, 2 do not form a triangle.



Enter an integer: 3
Enter another integer: 4
Enter one more integer: 5

The perimeter of a triangle with sides 3, 4, 5 is 12

Reminders:

Be sure to put a comment at the top of your program that tells what the program does – not how it does it - and include your name. Use proper indenting, follow naming conventions, leave spaces around operators, and comment your code. Paste your output onto the bottom of the source code inside a comment.See the Style guide for all the requirments

Remember, it is a good idea to test input for which you know the correct answer. the sample input given here is a good place to start.

Upload the program with the output and click Finish. See Assignment Submission for details.
