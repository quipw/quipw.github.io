Lab 4 Kilograms to Pounds Conversion

Write a program to display the table below which shows kilograms from 20 to 200 and the equivalent weight in pounds.  (1 kilogram is 2.2 pounds). Use a loop. You decide which kind. Notice that in this case you will be incrementing by 20 on each iteration rather than 1.

Use a constant for the conversion factor (2.2). Give it a descriptivbe name that tells what the constant is.
