Homework 5 Triangle Static Methods

This project will contain two classes: MyTriangle and MyTriangleTest

MyTriangle
First create the class called MyTriangle containing the following two static methods

/**
   Determines if the three given values can form a triangle
   @param s1 the first value
   @param s2 the second value
   @param s3 the third value
   @return true if the three values can form a valid triangle else it returns false
*/

public static boolean isValid(double s1, double s2, doubl3 s3)



/**
   Gets the area of a triangle with the given sides
   @param s1 the first value
   @param s2 the second value
   @param s3 the third value
   @return the area of the triangle with the given sides 
        or zero if the values do not form a valid triangle
*/

public static double area(double s1, double s2, doubl3 s3)


Area of a triangle
The following formula can be used to calculate the area of a triangle  given the three sides

formula for area of a triangle given the 3 sides

Note: The area() method should return 0 if the sides do not form a valid triangle.

Important: Do not print from the methods isValid() or area() in MyTriangle. Only print from the main method in MyTriangleTest or a method it calls for the purpose of printing.

MyTriangleTest
MyTriangleTest will call both methods of the MyTriangle class and demonstrate that they work. Tell whether the values form a valid triangle as well as printing the area.

Be sure to show at least two tests: one where the three numbers are a triangle and one where they are not. You do not ask the user for input. You can just "hard-code" all the values into your test program. Code all the test cases in the main method and run the program one time only. Do NOT edit the test class, change the data, and run again. Your test program will contian several (at least two) test cases. modified 10/27/11
