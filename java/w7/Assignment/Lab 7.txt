Lab 7 Searching

Write a program that fills an array with 50 random integers between 1 and 100. Use a loop. After the array is filled, use another loop to print the array with 10 values per line (You can take the index of the loop %10 to do this.) Now generate another random integer between 1 and 100, the target. Print the target. Use a third loop to search for the target in the array and print a message giving the indexes if the array that contain the target value. If the array does not contain the target value, print a message saying that the array does not contain the target.

Show several runs of your program including one where the target is found, one where it is not, and one where it is found multiple times.

You will use three loops. You can do this with fewer loops, but I want you to use loops in all the specified places.
Getting Random Numbers

You can use the Random class and nextInt() method to get random integers. The Random class is in java.util so you need to import that library.
To create a Random object:

Random generator = new Random();

To get a random integer between 1 and 100:

 generator.nextInt(100) will give you a random integer between 0 and 99. If you want a number between 1 and 100 you need to add 1, like this

      number = generator.nextInt(100) + 1;
Printing 10 numbers to a line

You can use System.out.print to print multiple numbers on one line. Then you can use an if statement similar to the one below to print a blank line after printing 10 numbers. This may not be exactly what you need but will give you a place to start.

 if (i % 10 == 0 )
 {
 System.out.println();
 }
